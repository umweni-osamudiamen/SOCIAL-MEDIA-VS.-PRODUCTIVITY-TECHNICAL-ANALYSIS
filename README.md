Analysis Recommendation

1. Following the huge number of notifications recorded across the various workplaces, it is necessary to ensure a strict policy restricting the use of social media in the workplace except when necessary.

2. Upon possible mobile restriction browsing, a dedicated channel is provided to mitigate the effect on those who require such services for proper performance.
Ensure workers adhere to company policy on screen time, and where there is none, enact one.

3. Due to large screen time, there should be more engagement for the workers to keep them busy, thereby reducing their media time.

4. In offices where there are free internet services, it is recommended that such premises put a limitation on data usage per day or time
   
5. It is recommended that the internet be restricted when social media is involved; otherwise very important.

6. It is recommended that a lecture be held to educate the people on the need for screen time regulation and a productivity award to encourage more productivity.

Conclusion:

From the analysis observations, it is clear that most workers, including students, spend more time on TikTok than on other social media and considering the time they spend sleeping and on screen time. It is also very clear that the IT worker had better job satisfaction than other workers, so we recommend that every organisation come up with a social media use SOP to ensure productivity is improved.

Subsequent research should be geared towards the finding organisational policies on social media usage and its effectiveness.
